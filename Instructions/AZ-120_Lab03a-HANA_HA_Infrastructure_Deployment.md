## Scenario
  
In preparation for deployment of SAP NetWeaver on Azure, Adatum Corporation wants to implement a demo that will illustrate highly available implementation of SAP NetWeaver on Azure VMs running the SUSE distribution of Linux.

## Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

-   Provision Azure resources necessary to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

-   Configure operating system of Azure VMs running Linux to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

-   Configure clustering on Azure VMs running Linux to support a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment

## Requirements

-   A Microsoft Azure subscription with the sufficient number of available DSv2 and Dsv3 vCPUs (four Standard_DS1_v2 VMs with 1 vCPU each and two Standard_D4s_v3 VMs with 4 vCPUs each) in an Azure region that supports availability zones

-   A lab computer running Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or Windows Server 2019 with access to Azure


## Exercise 1: Provision Azure resources necessary to support highly available SAP NetWeaver deployments

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy Azure infrastructure compute components necessary to configure Linux clustering. This will involve creating a pair of Azure VMs running Linux SUSE in the same availability set.

### Task 1: Create a virtual network that will host a highly available SAP NetWeaver deployment.

1.  From the lab computer, start a Web browser, and navigate to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com

1.  If prompted, sign in with the work or school or personal Microsoft account with the owner or contributor role to the Azure subscription you will be using for this lab and the the Global Administrator role in the Azure AD tenant associated with your subscription.

1.  In the Azure Portal, start a Bash session in Cloud Shell. 

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are launching Cloud Shell in the current Azure subscription, you will be asked to create an Azure file share to persist Cloud Shell files. If so, accept the defaults, which will result in creation of a storage account in an automatically generated resource group.

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to specify the Azure region that supports availability zones and where you want to create resources for this lab (replace `<region>` with the name of the Azure region which supports availablity zones):

    ```cli
    LOCATION='<region>'
    ```

    > **Note**: Consider using **East US** or **East US2** regions for deployment of your resources. 

    > **Note**: Ensure to use the proper notation for the Azure region (short name which does not include a space, e.g. **eastus** rather than **US East**)

    > **Note**: To identify Azure regions which support availability zones, refer to [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-region)

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to set the value of the variable `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` to the name of the resource group containing the resources you provisioned in the previous task:

    ```cli
    RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME='az12003a-sap-RG'
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to create a resource group in the region you specified:

    ```cli
    az group create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to create a virtual network with a single subnet in the resource group you created:

    ```cli
    VNET_NAME='az12003a-sap-vnet'

    VNET_PREFIX='10.3.0.0/16'

    SUBNET_NAME='sapSubnet'

    SUBNET_PREFIX='10.3.0.0/24'

    az network vnet create --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --location $LOCATION --name $VNET_NAME --address-prefixes $VNET_PREFIX --subnet-name $SUBNET_NAME --subnet-prefixes $SUBNET_PREFIX
    ```

1.  In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to identify the Resource Id of the subnet of the newly created virtual network:

    ```cli
    az network vnet subnet list --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME --vnet-name $VNET_NAME --query "[?name == '$SUBNET_NAME'].id" --output tsv
    ```

1.  Copy the resulting value to Clipboard. You will need it in the next task.

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to list all resource groups you created in this lab:

    ```cli
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'$RESOURCE_GROUP_PREFIX')]".name --output tsv
    ```

1. Verify that the output contains only the resource group you created in this lab. This resource group with all of their resources will be deleted in the next task.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1. In the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to delete the resource group and their resources.

    ```cli
    az group list --query "[?starts_with(name,'$RESOURCE_GROUP_PREFIX')]".name --output tsv | xargs -L1 bash -c 'az group delete --name $0 --no-wait --yes'
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

> **Result**: After you completed this exercise, you have removed the resources used in this lab.
